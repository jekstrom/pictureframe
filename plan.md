An app that allows uploading images that will then display on the picture frame.

It should also pull in images from Google and Amazon and other platforms that you want to display.

When you upload an image, it converts it into the bits that the picture frame can read, and then makes it available on a public url so that the picture frame can download it.

Static website hosted on blob storage with a cdn in front of it.

Api layer with azure functions.


# Onboarding

The esp32 will call a service every day to get a new image and a new SAS token to get images. The SAS token lasts for 3 days (just in case of connection hiccup).

When someone gets a new picture frame, they load a micro-SD card with connection info:
* their wifi network SSID
* their wifi network password
* a guid that is generated by the app after login

When a device connects for the first time, it passes the guid to a function. This function looks that guid up in a table, and if it exists, returns a SAS token that will expire in 3 days, used for retrieving the uploaded
pictures for this user's account.

*TODO* automate this process by having a QR code that is printed and shipped with the picture frame that can be scanned in to the account instead (something like that).

*TODO* ad-hoc wifi network setup
